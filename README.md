# Zynstra-Technical-34

Candidate 34 for the technical part of the Zynstra interview process.
To begin with the plan was to use the exact values as given in the questions with the assumption that at some point dynamic user input might be needed, this is yet to be added as of 10/10/2022.
The variables such as API endpoint etc are set at the top of the python file, a testing file will be added once the program is complete.
